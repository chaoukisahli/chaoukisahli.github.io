## Master's thesis: Numerical approach of the natural convection of a Newtonian fluid within a semi-elliptical tank saturated by a porous medium
We aim to numerically study the natural convection of an incompressible Newtonian
fluid, under laminar and steady-state conditions, within a semi-elliptical tank saturated
with a porous medium. The internal and external walls of the tank are maintained at
constant temperatures. By employing Darcy's law, the Boussinesq approximation, and
the vorticity-stream function formulation, we express the continuity, momentum, and
heat equations in an elliptical coordinate system. The mathematical model is solved
using the finite volume method. The obtained results, which investigate the distribution
of isotherms and streamlines, are presented and interpreted while considering
geometric factors and the modified Rayleigh-Darcy number.
